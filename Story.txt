Belgium is a small country in Western Europe with complex ethnic composition. Of the country's total population, 59 percent speak Dutch language, 40 percent speak French and 1 percent speak German.
Inspite of these diversities, the leaders of Belgium decided to make an arrangement for power sharing. Between 1970 and 1993, they amended their Constitution four times.
The Constitution provides that the number of Dutch and French speaking ministers shall be equal in the Central Government and the State Governments. The State Governments are not subordinate to the Central Government.
Contrary to it, leaders of the Sinhala community in Sri Lanka sought to secure dominance over government by virtue of their majority and refused to share power with the Tamils.
